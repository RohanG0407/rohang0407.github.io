I am a CS PhD student at UT Austin advised by [Calvin Lin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/) and [Shravan Narayan](https://shravanrn.com) working on building defenses for micro-architecture side-channel attacks.

Previously, I worked in the [Purdue University Programming Languages Group (PurPL)](https://purduepl.github.io) advised by Professor [Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/) where I worked on path explosion for symbolic execution engines and accelerating irregular algorithms with ray-tracing hardware.
