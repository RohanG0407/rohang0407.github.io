I am a PhD student at UT Austin advised by [Calvin Lin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/) and [Shravan Narayan](https://shravanrn.com) working on building defenses for micro-architecture side-channel attacks.

Previously, I worked in the [Purdue University Programming Languages Group (PurPL)](https://purduepl.github.io) advised by Professor [Milind Kulkarni](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind/) where I worked on path explosion for symbolic execution engines and accelerating irregular algorithms with ray-tracing hardware.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
